We’re living in a future where nearly everything we use has been programmed with a mix of underlying hardware and software to bring our current world to life.

We’ve gone from box TV’s that were 8–10 from our couch to smartphones inches away from our face, immersive augmented & virtual reality games. From vintage gassed automobiles to electric-powered Teslas that can detect and prevent an accident faster than any human can.



These things were built by people no smarter than YOU are. But they understand the fundamentals of computer science. They know how to code. In this series, my goal is to teach you how to code, from the ground up.

### Why should you learn to code?

In this series of posts, I’m going to take you through the journey of learning to code by breaking down computer science & programming fundamentals and giving you practical knowledge to build something real.



But why should you learn to code in the first place? Well, if you take a look at the post-pandemic world you’ll notice things are shifting. Industries are rising and falling in desperate need of innovation. Technology is shaping up to be the answer to many of the world’s greatest problems.



Programming skills can allow you to be a part of this shift. With enhanced job opportunities, security, or even be entrepreneurial and create something special. Be ahead of the curve.

### What is Coding?

Code is the software that runs on and powers all technology from smartphones apps webpages to military jets and tanks. While coding is the process of writing these applications, detailing a set of instructions and logic that describes what you want to build and have happen. This then interacts with the desired hardware to give the intended outcome and bring things to life.

In a nutshell, writing code is telling a computer what you want it to do. Think of it as a cooking recipe. A computer has no idea what it has to do, it needs to be taught.

#### Language

Just like we use real human languages to communicate like people. We need to communicate with a computer in a way it can understand. We accomplish this by utilizing computer programming languages.

Most read just like English however their vocabulary is a set of instructions with grammar rules and keywords used to express a task. It then compiles into[binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code)that a computer interprets.

There is an endless amount of computer programming languages. Each with various purposes, differences, and structure. However, the underlying principles remain across the board in the same way sentences are built using subject, object, verb, etc. regardless of language.

#### Tools

Luckily, it doesn’t take much to get started. Long gone are the days where engineers had to use punchcards to instruct the first computers. Now, all you need is a modern-day computer, laptop or Macbook to get you started.

You will need to tell the computer what to do through a set of text files. Technically this can be through your computer notepad but we’re more advance than that, we’ll be using what is called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is a high-level software edit these text files and much more.

My suggestion for this would be [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It’s free, cross-platform, and powerful. Cannot go wrong here.

### Getting Started

Here we’ll create our first program.
